```
## First Pull
### Dragon Only
- **Twilight Destroyer** (dragon)
	- _Twilight Flame_ - targeted DoT that drops a puddle.
		- Don't drop the puddle where you're going to LoS _Umbral Wind_.
	- _Umbral Wind_ - heavy damage knockback.
		- LoS this on corners or the pillars near the broken bridges.
- **Twilight Earthcaller** - _Mass Tremor_, heavy party damage. Priority kick.
- **Twilight Brute** - _Obsidian Stomp_, swirlies. Dodge.
### To First Overseer
- First _Bloodlust_.
- **Twilight Overseer**
	- _Rive_ - stacking tank debuff. Increases physical damage taken.
		- May need to hold _Pain Suppression_ for later into pull if the tank runs dry.
	- _Reckless Tactic_ - enrage effect. Soothe.
## Dragon Riding
- Priority: **Twilight Destroyer** and patrolling **Twilight Overseer** pack when they can both be hit.
	- Wait for return trip if they're not together. Prioritize **Twilight Destroyer** if they never sync.
- Priority: Double **Twilight Overseer** pack before first boss.
## Bridge Pull
- Four **Twilight Earthcallers** and a **Twilight Overseer**
	- Kicks and stops must be on point. Be prepared for heavy burst if one isn't getting stopped. If more than one goes off, probably going to wipe.
## First Boss: General Umbriss
- First _Bloodlust_ if it hasn't been sent on first pull.
- _Commanding Roar_ - heavy group damage.
	- _Mindbender_ timing late into cast.
	- Send _Mind Blast_ the global after the cast completes. _Entropic Rift_ will pop immediately after the _Rock Spike_ damage with extensions.
- _Rock Spike_ - heavy group damage to three targets that leaves a puddle behind.
	- _Protective Light_, _Fade_, _Shield_ on yourself and one other.
	- Move to outer edge to preserve space. Stack puddles in tight with each other.
	- Can _Shadowmeld_ early in the cast.
- _Skullsplitter_ - tankbuster with a stacking bleed.
	- May need _Pain Suppression_ or chained _Rapture_ shields if the tank isn't handling it themselves.
- _Dragon Swooshy Lines_ - move away from the lines into safe zones.
	- _Penance_ on the move to maintain uptime.
## Khardros' Anvil
- **Twilight Beguiler** - _Chained Mind_, channeled stun. Priority kick and stop.
	- _Shadowflame Bolt_ - random damage that can be deadly if overlapped with _Molten Wake_.
- **Molten Giant**
	- Sometimes stunned by the **Twilight Beguilers**, which can throw off timings.
	- _Molten Wake_ - heavy party damage with a stacking fire damage debuff.
		- Send _Mindbender_ ahead of cast so we can reset for the next one.
		- _Barrier_ and party defensives are important.
	- _Lava Fist_ - heavy fire damage tankbuster. Scarier the longer the mob is alive.
		- Tank needs a defensive for every one. May need to send _Pain Suppression_ or big _Rapture_ shields ahead of cast.
- **Twilight Flamerender** - _Blazing Shadowflame_, line nuke that's kinda misleading.
	- _Shadowflame Slash_ - heavy tank damage. May need externals.
- **Twilight Earthcaller** - _Mass Tremor_, priority kick.
## Second Boss: Forgemaster Throngus
- Second _Bloodlust_ if it wasn't sent for first boss.
- _Forge Weapon_ - pulsing party damage for 4s.
	- _Mindbender_ as best as possible. Hold for _Forge Swords_ if necessary, can cover with just _Mind Blast_ and defensives.
	- _Forge Swords_ includes _Molten Spark_ - must have _Mindbender_.
- _Forge Axe_: _Fiery Cleave_ - conal that leaves behind fire. Bait into walls to preserve space.
- _Forge Swords_: 
	- _Molten Flurry_ - tankbuster. _Pain Suppression_ is a friend.
	-  _Molten Spark_ - targeted DoT that drops puddles on expiration.
		- If the tank LoS's the _Molten Flurry_, _Sparks_ won't come out.
- _Forge Mace_: _Molten Mace_ - 1000% extra damage. Kite or die.
	- Footsteps leave behind fire puddles as he moves. Kite smart.
## Warlock Hallways
- **Twilight Beguilers** - _Chained Mind_, priority kick.
- **Twilight Warlock** - 
	- _Enveloping Shadowflame_ - random targeted curse. Heal absorb and DoT. Can stack?
		- Ideally someone will have a decurse. If not, be prepared to churn a lot of healing through it.
		- Can be deadly if combined with _Ascension_.
	- _Shadowflame Bolt_, random targeted damage.
		- Be prepared to LoS the cast if they're not being kicked or stopped.
- **Twilight Enforcer** - _Rage_, enrage, stacking attack speed buff. 
	- Some soothes only remove one stack, others remove the entire thing.
	- Short duration, can be removed with a _Hand of Justice_ or similar stun.
	- Kite at high stacks.
- **Twilight Lavabender** - _Ascension_, heavy pulsing party damage. Cast at 50% HP. 
	- Priority target once _Ascension_ is cast.
	- _Mindbender_ timing. Keep an eye on HP if needing to send it earlier.
	- Also has a PBAoE component that people should move out of.
	- Defensives, _Pain Suppression_ on yourself, and health potions are important.
	- Ideally have 2m CDs for the bigger pulls.
### Double Lavabender
- Hopefully the route skips. If not, hopefully DPS aren't cleaving. If they are, hopefully you have defensives and enough damage to burn them before you run out.
	- Send _Bloodlust_ on the double pull if it happens.
## Third Boss: Drahga Shadowburner/Valiona
### Phase One - Drahga Shadowburner
- _Curse of Entropy_ - three curses sent out with healing absorb and DoT.
	- _Mindbender_ timing, every cast.
- _Invocation of Shadowflame_ - summons an add that will fixate. If it reaches you, it explodes and everyone dies.
	- Snipe with _Shadow Word: Death_ for extra damage/healing.
### Phase Two - Valiona
- Second/Third _Bloodlust_ once **Valiona** spawns.
- If double **Twilight Lavabender** was skipped, fight towards the back of the platform so knocks don't send aggro.
	- Don't pull with _Avenger's Shield_ once **Valiona** spawns. Can bounce to **Lavabenders**.
- Tank can move into the slot behind the brazier to eliminate swirly mechanics from the fight.
	- **Invoked Shadowflame Spirit** will spawn in her hurtbox though, which melee needs to be aware of.
- Includes previous phase mechanics.
- _Twilight Buffet_ - group knockback with heavy damage.
	- Defensive timing. _Protective Light_, _Fade_, _Shield_ on two.
- _Devouring Flame_ - conal burn. May need to send externals here.
## Corruptor Stairwell
- **Twilight Destroyer** can be skipped if you have count.
- **Mutated Hatchlings** - applies _Shadow Wound_ on death, stacking shadow damage amp.
	- Makes the **Twilight Destroyer** damage scarier. Lining is even more important.
		- Tank needs to send defensives for _Umbral Wind_.
- **Faceless Corruptor**
	- _Mind Piercer_ - swirlies. Dodge or get mind controlled and likely cleaved to death.
	- _Corrupt_ - random target heavy channeled damage.
		- Always cast after _Mind Piercer_ pops.
		- Needs a defensive. Often an external. Heavy healing.
		- Can be _Feigned_, _Vanished_, _Cloaked_, _Shadowmelded_, _Spell Reflected_, etc.
		- Pre-_Atonement_ (not _Shield_), _defensive Penance_ (possibly buffed by _Radiance_), _Smite_ + _Shield_
		- Stacks from **Mutated Hatchlings** makes this scarier and may necessitate _Pain Suppression_
### Double Corruptor
- Send external to one, _defensive Penance_ to other.
- _Rapture_ chains are important. Be sure to buff with 4pc.
## Fourth Boss: Erudax, the Duke of Below
- _Void Surge_ - heavy pulsing AoE damage over 3s.
	- Sends quickly after pull.
	- _Mindbender_ ~10s before cast. _Mind Blast_ ~2s.
	- _Radiance_ as cast starts. _Dark Reprimand_ as damage comes out. _Void Blast_ through damage.
		- Can double-_Radiance_.
- _Shadow Gale_ - slowly closing circle. Find the safe spot and move early while dodging tentacles.
	- _Abyssal Corruption_ - targeted AoE spells. Move away from party while staying in the circle and avoiding tentacles.
	- _Mindbender_ is important here and there SHOULD be time to get it farmed back for both events.
		- If the movement makes it impossible, _Rapture_ and _Barrier_ let you bridge.
	- Pre-_Atonement_ manually if you sent both _Radiance_ charges.
	- Tentacles can be squashed with immunities (e.g., _Divine Shield_).
- _Crush_ - tankbuster with knockback. May need _Pain Suppression_ or other external if the tank is dry.
