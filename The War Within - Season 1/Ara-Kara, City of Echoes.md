```
- _Void Tendrils_ is nice for rooting the spider adds on **Avanoxx**
	- Has some use with the **Engorged Crawler** to open up space if your melee is melee-brained and doesn't want to get out of _Toxic Rupture_.
## Pre-Pull
- Can get Tailoring buff (_Silk Wrap_) from **Discordant Attendant** (corpse) prior to starting the key.
	- Gives a targeted stun on the extra-action button for 1 minute.
## First Pull - Ixin
- Do not _Mind Blast_ **Ixin**! The _Entropic Rift_ will pop up and miss all other ground-bound mobs.
- Large pull to **Ixin**.
	- Use _Silk Wrap_ if you have it from the pre-pull.
	- First _Bloodlust_ here.
- _Rapture_ as everyone is running due to random-targeting from the **Jabbing Fliers** and **Trilling Attendants**.
- Ensure **Trilling Attendants**' _Resonant Barrages_ are kicked or stopped.
- Ensure **Ixin**'s _Horrifying Shrill_ is kicked or stopped (AoE fear).
## Second Platform - Nakt
- DO _Mind Blast_ **Nakt** - the whiff doesn't matter and the summons are small.
- Clear trash around **Nakt**.
	- **Engorged Crawlers** randomly target _Venomous Spit_ - large poison DoT.
		- _Poison Cleansing Totem_ and poison cleanses are high value here.
		- _Rapture_ offers good spread to help people when between defensives.
	- Before trash is fully killed, return to first platform for _Silk Wrap_.
- **Nakt** starts with _Call of the Brood_, massive physical AoE damage.
	- Send _Silk Wrap_ after first tick of damage if you have it, otherwise...
	- Defensive on pull, including party defensive (e.g., _Barrier_, _Zephyr_, etc.)
	- Hopefully dies before second _Call of the Brood_ - if not, be prepared with _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, double-_Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand (Penance)_ combo.
## Third Platform - Atik
- Maybe _Mind Blast_ **Atik**? Depends on the pull.
## First Boss: Avanoxx
- _Alerting Shrill_ - short duration, high AoE pulsing damage that summons adds:
	- Requires defensives - ideally _Fade_, _Protective Light_ and a _Power Word: Shield_.
	- Stand with tank between you and boss so that adds don't get eaten.
	- Every cast: _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand (Penance)_, _Void Blast_, _Shadow Word: Death_.
		- If using double-_Radiance_ need to be sure that the second _Radiance_ is landing as the damage starts so that _Dark Reprimand_ has time to connect and negate following pulses.
	- _Barrier_ early so that everyone piles in.
- _Gossamer Onslaught_ - dance party to avoid swirlies. Swirlies leave behind webbing that cuts off the platform.
	- Move towards edge of the platform prior to cast then dance in the direction the tank goes.
	- _Mind Blast_ ~1s before the cast starts and the _Entropic Rift_ will pop after damage ends.
	- At longer range and higher haste values (~25-30%?), there's time to stutter step _Mind Blast_ and _Smite_ casts between swirlies.
	- Move back towards the tank for _Alerting Shrill_.
- _Voracious Bite_ - tank buster.
	- May occasionally need to send _Pain Suppression_ if the tank is caught between cooldowns.
- May ignore adds from _Alerting Shrill_ starting ~40%.
	- _Void Tendrils_ and _Psychic Scream_ are high value stalling tools here.
## Bridge Trash
- **Hulking Bloodguard** casts heavy AoE _Slam_
	- Not a lot of damage, but threatening if casts of _Web Bolt_ come out from **Bloodstained Webmage**.
	- Also have an aura that reduces damage to all other mobs.
- **Bloodstained Webmage** cast _Revolting Volley_ - AoE poison that must be interrupted.
- **Bloodstained Assistants** cast _Extraction Strike_ which is a high-damage tank buster that does more damage the more casts they get off.
	- May need to use _Pain Suppression_ late into pulls.
- **Sentry Stagshell** needs to die quickly. _Alarm Shrill_ must not go off.
- If party goes left after the bridge, the outermost packs can be skipped with _Mind Soothe_.
- Second Boss (**Anub'zekt**) can be pulled from outside the arena and will snap party to him:
	- _Rescue_ down to the arena.
	- _Spatial Paradox_ and pull.
	- Be cautious, first person to hit the boss gets the first round of _Infestation_.
## Second Boss: Anub'zekt
- _Infestation_ is the main threat - heavy DoT effect that drops _Ceaseless Swarm_ cyclones when the DoT expires.
	- Won't retarget a player until it has completed a cycle through the entire party.
	- _Rapture_, _defensive-Penance_, _Pain Suppression_ all good tools for covering players.
- _Ceaseless Swarm_ annoying swirlies. Best to drop them away from where the party wants to go.
- _Eye of the Swarm_ - move into circle and play towards the left-most side of it. Tank should be standing on right side in order to ensure _Impale_ doesn't cover the usable space.
	- Three _Infestations_ go out during this phase, good timing for _Mindbender_ coverage.
	- Drop _Ceaseless Swarm_ to the right side of the circle so that they (hopefully) move away from the direction the party is moving.
- _Burrow Charge_ can be dodged at moderate range by combining _Feather_ or _Body and Soul_ (_Power Word: Shield_) with a self-targeted _Penance_.
	- Move speed stacks and gives you enough speed to walk out of the vector.
	- If you have to get hit, get hit early in the charge. Otherwise the eruption at the end of the charge path does extra damage and will likely kill.
	- The hit does a knock effect and can launch you off the platform if you're too close to the outer edge. Hilarious.
- **Bloodstained Webmages** (adds that appear during fight) cast _Silken Restraints_, must be interrupted. 
	- Will stun the target and increase the damage _Infestation_ does, often locking players into _Eye of the Swarm_ or _Impale_
- _Impale_ - conal. Don't get hit. Or do, if you're bad.
	- Casts after every _Burrow Charge_ and at various intervals.
## The Undercache (indoors)
- Another _Silk Wrap_ right after **Anub'zekt**.
	- Send on **Blood Overseer**.
- Everything in here drops _Black Blood_ on engagement, which is the same mechanic used on final boss to avoid _Cosmic Singularity_.
	- Just don't step in them. If you do get rooted in it, _Psychic Scream_ the mob or _Shadowmeld_.
- **Blood Overseer** - interrupt _Venom Volley_, dodge _Erupting Webs_.
- **Winged Carrier** casts _Dashing Strike_ at random targets and it sucks.
- **Nerubian Hauler** - hopefully route skips this mob, but if not:
	- _Massive Slam_ is a souped-up version of the slam from the _Bloodguards_ earlier. Stuns, so be sure you're not sending _Penance_ during the cast.
	- Damage is amplified every cast (_Intensity_), so the longer the mob is alive the harder that stun will hit. Send defensives like _Barrier_ as the damage starts to look like it'll turn into a one-shot.
## Third Boss: Kikatal, the Harvester
- _Cultivated Poisons_ - party-wide poison DoT that sends out waves of poison when the effect expires or is dispelled.
	- Every cast: _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand_, _Void Blast_, _Shadow Word: Death_.
		- Can be tight if there's too much panic movement, but you should be able to farm back _Mindbender_ for every cast.
		- May need to cast _Radiance_ someone in the melee pile due to the way players tend to spread on this fight. Self-casting can miss.
		- If you have a lot of range you may need to pre-_Atonement_ them with _Flash Heal_, _Renew_, or _Power Word: Shield_.
	- _Poison Cleansing Totem_ is extremely high value here, but everyone needs to be pre-positioned, stationary, and ready to dodge waves before it's dropped.
	- Expiration often coincides with _Erupting Webs_, forcing dodges:
		- Don't be moving towards the waves when they cast out or you'll walk into the wave and die.
	- Third or fourth (?) cast coincides with the start of a _Cosmic Singularity_ - ideally party cleanses early, but if not, be sure to set up a safe _Black Blood_ pool early.
		- Pray your party doesn't send a wave at you while you're locked down because your interrupt is only available once per _Cosmic Singularity_!
- _Cosmic Singularity_ - sucks in party and then explodes them to death.
	- Knock _Black Blood_ out of the drones that run around the fight then position so that the drag will move you to the blood once it's safe to do so. 
		- _Purge the Wicked_ mouseover macro is your friend.
	- Coincides closely with _Erupting Webs_:
		- Immediately _Psychic Scream_ the blood that is holding you in place so you can dodge the webs. 
			- Cooldown on _Psychic Scream_ is tight without the talent _Psychic Voice_. It's unnecessary, but you need to be casting as close to the finish of _Cosmic Singularity_ as you can.
	- Occasionally coincides closely with _Cultivated Poisons_.
		- Pray your party doesn't launch poison at you while you're stuck in a blood.
	- _Black Blood_ damage is fairly minor but does exist. Good to send some healing around and pre-_Atonement_ with _Flash Heal_ or _Renew_.
	- _Leap of Faith_ can save someone from the suck (if they suck and don't find a blood) if you pull them at 0.6s remaining in the cast.
- _Black Blood_ - the root that saves you.
	- Any kick, _Freedom_, or CC effect can stop the channel that roots you.
		- _Psychic Scream_ is up for every _Cosmic Singularity_ (with or without _Psychic Voice_) but there's no margin for error. If you get rooted ahead of the _Cosmic Singularity_ cast, you'll need to call for help getting out of the second root.
	- _Shadowmeld_ also drops the target and stops the channel.
