## Talents
- _Improved Purify_ - disease cleanse!
- _Mass Dispel_ - extra dispel buffer for fourth boss.
## First Pull
- First _Bloodlust_ here or on second pull.
- **Scrimshaw Enforcer** - _Shattering Bellow_, heavy AoE damage and interrupt.
	- Pop defensives and ensure everyone is topped.
- **Blacktar Bomber** - _Fire Bomb_, heavy single target damage.
	- Send stuns and stops right before and after _Shattering Bellow_ to prevent getting globaled.
## Second Pull - Top of Stairs
- First _Bloodlust_ here or on first pull.
- **Scrimshaw Enforcer** - _Shattering Bellow_
	- Can LoS this on the corner of the building.
- **Irontide Waveshaper** - _Watertight Shell_, 90% DR shield, pops for damage and 4s stun. Priority kick.
- **Irontide Raider** - _Iron Hook_, yoinks everyone in for _Savage Tempest_.
	- Time _Penance_ to coincide with pull.
	- Might be able to LoS this?
## Gallows
- Often a good choice for invis skips. Very dangerous.
- **Riptide Shredder**
	- _Iron Ambush_ - random, instant, single target damage. Pre-shield and defensive as the casts ready up.
	- _Singing Steel_ - Tankbuster that leaves a bleed. Be prepared with _Pain Suppression_ and _Rapture_ if you have leftovers between _Iron Ambushes_.
- Heavy chances of overlap between _Iron Hook_, _Iron Ambush_, _Fire Bomb_, and _Brackish Bolt_.
	- If tank isn't paying attention, _Iron Hook_ into _Burning Tar_ is deadly.
- Send everything you have and hope you burn a few down before _Mindbender_ expires. Damage is almost better than healing here.
## First Boss: Chopper Redhook
- _Heavy Ordnance_ - swirlies. Bombs spawn in swirly that isn't filled in (no sheen in the middle of the circle).
	- If the first bomb takes awhile to get hit, may need to soak or call for a soak on the third bomb.
	- Reasonably livable at +10s so far - just send defensives into it.
- _Iron Hook_ - most of the damage in this fight.
- **Irontide Powdershot** - _Molten Slug_, random target damage. Not terribly threatening.
## Covered Bridge
- **Ashvane Commander**
	- _Azerite Charge_ - targeted AoE. Leaves a heavy DoT.
		- Pre-shield target then send heavy healing in.
			- _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Shield_ if on you.
			- Great option for _Shadowmeld_.
		- Chained _Rapture_ shields are a good way to counter.
		- May need to _Pain Suppression_ the target depending on if they're pressing a defensive or not.
	- _Bolstering Shout_ - reduces damage for mobs by 75% for 8s. Priority kick.
- **Irontide Waveshaper** - _Watertight Shell_, priority kick.
- **Ashvane Spotter**
	- _Sighted Artillery_ - targeted AoE that leaves swirlies behind per tick. Can drop two swirlies before you have to move.
		- No longer does damage to mobs. Tragic.
	- _Bounding Retreat_ + _Evasive_ - leaps or runs from combat unless snared. Hope somebody has one, 'cuz you don't!
## Second Boss Trash
- Second _Bloodlust_ timing.
- **Ashvane Commander**, **Ashvane Spotter** can make for annoying overlaps that are visually busy. Keep an eye out.
- **Ashvane Cannoneer** - _Broadside_, line nuke. More visual noise. Don't get hit.
- **Irontide Curseblade** - _Cursed Slash_, stacking debuff that increases damage taken by 10%.
## Second Boss: Dread Captain Lockwood
- _Evasive_ - keep her snared or it's gonna huuuurt.
	- _Gut Shot_ - heavy single-target damage and DoT if nobody is tanking her.
- _Fiery Ricochet_ - heavy targeted damage that jumps and leaves a DoT.
	- Stand opposite your damage dealers and you can sometimes outrange the bounce.
	- _Mindbender_ ~5s before cast to get CDR going to cover the second cast.
		- Every third cast you'll have to take without _Mindbender_ - call for defensives and throw _Barrier_.
	- _Fade_ early so that it's up in time for repeats.
	- If boss _Withdraws_ immediately after a cast, it can get spicy without something to _Atonement_ off. 
		- _Rapture_, _Pain Suppression_, etc.
- _Intermission Swirlies_ (??) - three spaces get filled with swirlies. 
	- Move towards the center of the area once she casts _Withdraw_.
	- Try to dodge into openings left earlier in the sequence.
## Town Trash
- **Bilge Rat Demolisher** (giant) - _Crushing Slam_, heavy group damage.
	- Send _Mindbender_ around these.
	- Can be LoS'd on the corner of the building, depending on where tank plays.
	- Send stops on casters as _Crushing Slam_ is happening to avoid getting globaled.
- **Bilge Rat Tempest** - _Choking Waters_, targeted nuke with silence. Priority kick.
	- Magic debuff is dispellable if it's not on you.
- **Bilge Rat Pillager** (murloc) - _Stinky Vomit_, moderate disease DoT.
	- Finally, a use for _Improved Purify_!
- **Bilge Rat Buccaneer** - _Banana Rampage_, leaves bananas on the floor that will stun you. Don't step in them.
- **Ashvane Sniper** squad - randomly targets and shoots people. Send stops and prepare for a lot of emergency healing.
	- Skippable with _Mind Soothe_.
## Town Square Trash
- Third _Bloodlust_.
- **Ashvane Invader** + **Ashvane Commander** - overlaps between _Iron Hook_ and _Azerite Charge_ can be rough. Send _Mindbender_ around _Iron Hook_ to keep people topped.
- **Ashvane Invader** - _Stinging Venom Coating_ - stacking poison DoT on the tank. 
	- May need to cycle _Rapture_ if they're not able to dispel in the double pack.
- **Ashvane Waveshaper** - _Watertight Shell_. Priority kick.
- **Ashvane Destroyer** - _Ferocity_, gives mob a ton of Haste. Priority target.
## Third Boss: Hadal Darkfathom
- _Break Water_ - leaves swirlies under players that pop for extremely heavy damage.
	- Pre-position away from the statue and leave room for tank to dodge _Crashing Tide_.
	- _Fade_, _Protective Light_ and _Shield_ every cast.
		- Other classes with weak defensives (Shaman) will need _Shield_.
		- Generally try to have three _Shields_ out - start shielding ~12s before cast unless using _Rapture_.
	- _Mindbender_ timing, but not really a healing check.
	- Send _Barrier_ after the swirlies spawn.
- _Crashing Tide_ - line nuke for tank to dodge.
- _Tidal Surge_ - two waves of water wall.
	- Hide behind the statue in the center of the room.
	- Overlaps with _Crashing Tide_ and _Break Water_ on third cycle. Leave room for tank to send line nuke out and then quickly move.
- If the corner pack isn't pulled, send _Mind Soothe_ while moving between _Tidal Surge_ positions to prevent proximity pulling.
## Fourth Boss: Viq'Goth
- Fourth _Bloodlust_ mid-fight is possible.
- Pre-_Atonement_ as coming up to pull.
- _Putrid Waters_ - enormous upfront damage and heavy DoT on two targets every 20s.
	- _Fade_ every cast. Defensives must be sent before the projectile begins - damage is calculated on cast not on hit.
		- Can use _Shields_ in-flight though.
	- Most threatening aspect of fight, not the _Slam_.
	- DoT will damage and knock anyone near target when dispelled.
		- Dispel vulnerable targets first (e.g., Shaman).
		- In full-melee groups, ensure people are pre-spread for dispels.
		- _Mass Dispel_ can be used to catch up in emergency.
- **Demolishing Terror** - _Slam_, heavy group damage. Priority target.
- **Gripping Terror** - releases the cannon dude.
	- Sometimes worth splitting damage on the last set so that you can kill boss and get rid of **Demolishing Terror**.
