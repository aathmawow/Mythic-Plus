```
- _Shackle Undead_ - very useful for second boss and **Brittlebone Mages** to stop _Frostbolt Volley_.
- _Dispel Magic_ - useful for **Nar'zudah** to dispel _Dark Shroud_ (unnecessary if you have another purge).
- _Leap of Faith_ - if running with an Evoker, _Rescue_-mount skips lets you grab the last person.
- _Improved Purify_ - disease cleanse.
- _Void Tendrils_ - helpful for **Carrion Worms** on first boss and for maintaining the **Flesh Crafter** position with _Mind Control_ gimmicks.
## First Pull
- _Mind Soothe_ the **Corpse Harvester** to pick up the _Discarded Shield_.
- Get _Bloody Javelin_ after pull is finished.
- First _Bloodlust_ if you pull the **Zolramus Gatekeeper**
- **Zolramus Gatekeeper** - priority target.
	- _Wrath of Zolramus_ - heavy ticking party damage.
		- _Mindbender_ timing.
		- Use _Discarded Shield_ on the second cast as you usually won't have _Mindbender_ ready.
		- Use stops on _Throw Flesh_ during this cast.
	- _Clinging Darkness_ - moderate ticking magic debuff that scales the longer its on a target.
		- Dispel will cause it to jump to another target, resetting the damage scaling without adding duration.
- **Corpse Harvester**
	- _Drain Fluids_ - heavy channeled damage. Priority interrupt.
	- _Throw Flesh_ - random target casts. Be prepared with defensives. Priority stop.
- **Stitched Vanguard** - _Seething Rage_, enrage effect. Soothe.
- **Blight Bag** - _Disgusting Guts_, disease DoT. Dispel.
## Mind Control Gimmicks
- **Flesh Crafter** - _Dominate Mind_ the first one in the area after killing the rest of its pack. 
	- With a Druid or other root-capable class: set to passive, move away from the party then release and root.
	- _Throw Cleaver_ does insane damage but can hit enemy mobs. Party positions mobs so the priority target takes the cleaver.
	- Recast _Dominate Mind_ once the pack is dead then move on, releasing it for the next pack.
	- Continue this until after the second boss.
## First Boss: Blightbone
- Not a high-damage fight but has moments of extreme damage that needs to be defensived.
- _Heaving Retch_ - targeted conal that spawns **Carrion Worms**. Extremely heavy damage.
	- Target away from the rest of the party - behind boss.
		- Spawns **Carrion Worms** where the boss spews so letting them lag behind where you're moving is important.
	- Protection Paladins can stop the first three casts:
		- _Blessing of Sacrifice_ with _Righteous Protection_ prevents all damage for every other cast.
		- _Blessing of Spellwarding_ prevents all damage.
	- Warriors can _Spell Reflect_ every cast.
	- Need _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Shield_ and possibly _Pain Suppression_/_Desperate Prayer_ if targeted.
		- Can _Barrier_ a cast too.
	- Watch for classes with few defensives (Shaman) to run dry and _Pain Suppression_ them.
	- Kite the **Carrion Worms** while they get killed. _Psychic Scream_ and _Void Tendrils_ can be helpful.
- _Crunch_ - tankbuster. Not much you can do here as you need to hold _Pain Suppression_ for _Heaving Retch_.
## The Final Toll
- Can skip first pack by _Mind Soothing_ the pack on the left.
- **Zolramus Necromancer** - priority target. Summons **Brittlebone** minions.
	- **Brittlebone Mage** - _Frostbolt Volley_, high damage AoE. Priority kick.
		- Can _Dominate Mind_ or _Shackle Undead_ to stop casts. Keep **Flesh Crafter** in mind, though.
	- _Necrotic Bolt_ - high damage bolt with heal absorb. Kick when possible.
	- _Grim Fate_ - debuff that pops after 4s. High damage. Pre-_Shield_ and heal targets.
- **Skeletal Marauder** - _Gruesome Cleaver_, cleave strike. Don't stand in front.
	- _Rasping Scream_ - AoE fear. Kick or run out.
		- Can be dispelled. _Mass Dispel_ is your buddy if the party sucks.
	- _Boneshatter Shield_ - shield. Does backlash damage when it's popped, hurting the mob even more.
		- _Shadow Word: Death_ does extra shield damage. A lot of it. Send it.
- **Zolramus Sorcerer** - _Shadow Well_, puddle that does damage and prevents healing. Move out.
- **Nar'zudah**
	- _Death Burst_ - AoE swirlies. Don't get hit. Doy.
	- _Dark Shroud_ - magic buff that prevents melee attacks and does AoE damage. Priority purge.
	- _Grim Fate_ - debuff that pops damage in 6 yds after 4s. High damage. Pre-_Shield_ and heal targets.
- Grab the extra _Discarded Shield_ from before the bridge.
## Fall of Courage
- **Zolramus Necromancer** and two **Skeletal Marauders** usually.
	- Try to _Shackle Undead_ or _Dominate Mind_ the **Brittlebone Mage** to limit kicks. Need the kicks for _Rasping Scream_.
- Get _Bloody Javelin_ from behind the left-side pull.
- Can skip second **Zolramus Necromancer** with various gimmicks:
	- _Fade_ and run past.
	- _Rescue_ from the bridge to the ledge.
	- _Demonic Gateway_ from bridge to ledge.
### Heavy Pull before Boss
- **Skeletal Marauder** pack into **Skeletal Monstrosity**
- Second _Bloodlust_.
- **Skeletal Monstrosity**
	- _Reaping Winds_ + _Chill Scythe_ - PBAoE with a pulling snare effect. Run out.
	- _Frigid Spikes_ - swirlies under your feet. Don't be bad.
	- _Shatter_ - tankbuster.
## Second Boss: Amarth
- Pick up third _Bloody Javelin_
- _Bloody Javelin_ + _Mindbender_ on pull.
- _Land of the Dead_ - summons minions. Usually two **Brittlebone Warriors**, one **Brittlebone Crossbowman**, and two **Brittlebone Mages**
	- **Brittlebone Mages** - _Frostbolt Volley_, priority kick.
		- Should try to _Shackle Undead_ as it comes out. Ping that you're going to _Shackle_.
		- Any _Shackled_ mob MUST remain _Shackled_ for _Final Harvest_
	- **Brittlebone Crossbowman** - _Shoot_, shoots a random target. Can hurt. Priority stop.
	- **Brittlebone Warriors** - probably do something? Just kill them.
	- _Mindbender_ for every wave.
- _Necrotic Bolt_ - targeted cast with heal absorb.
- _Final Harvest_ - consumes minions. Living minions explode and wipe party. Dead minions explode into swirlies. Don't stand there.
	- _Tortured Echoes_ - heavy ticking party damage immediately after _Final Harvest_ completes.
		- 10 ticks of damage.
		- _Mindbender_ for every DoT phase.
		- Will likely need to send _Barrier_ and call for other party defensives during these phases at times.
- _Necrotic Breath_ - he's on spinners. Line nuke, spins in random (?) direction. Don't get hit.
	- _Necrotic Ichor_ - DoT that gets left if you're hit and somehow manage to survive. Don't get hit.
## The Stitchwerks (Necropolis)
- Need 76.84% before ascending. 75% if you're bringing a **Flesh Crafter**.
- More **Flesh Crafters** here for for _Dominate Mind_ gimmicks.
- **Kyrian Stitchwerk** - _Tenderize_, stacking tank debuff that increases physical damage taken.
	- _Mutilate_ - tankbuster that gets scary with _Tenderize_ stacks.

	- _Throw Cleaver_ - aim at each mob. Casts on pull.
	- _Drain Fluids_ - priority kick.
	- _Morbid Fixation_ - fixates and eats a target if it reaches. Deceptively fast.
		- _Blessing of Protection_ or other immunities will prevent the damage.
- **Goregrind** - same as **Kyrian Stitchwerk**
	- _Gut Slice_ - bleed effect.
- **Rotspew**
	- _Spew Disease_ - targeted damage that leaves _DIsease Cloud_ at their location.
		- May need externals for classes that run dry on defensives.
## Third Boss: Surgeon Stitchflesh
- Third _Bloodlust_ once **Surgeon Stitchflesh** is targetable.
- Send remaining _Bloody Javelins_
	- Second second only once the first has expired. Damage amp no longer stacks.
- **Stitchflesh's Creation** - _Festering Rot_, pulsing AoE damage that gets heavier the longer the mob is alive.

	- _Blessing of Protection_ or other immunities will prevent the damage.
## Fourth Boss: Nalthor the Rimebinder
- _Icebound Aegis_ - heavy shield with stacking pulsing damage.
	- Break shield as quickly as possible. First shield is easy as everyone is present. Later shields are 4-manned.
	- Release **Flesh Crafter** ~5s before the shield cast so that _Throw Cleaver_ will immediately pop the shield.
	- _Mindbender_ timing with pre-_Atonement_. Only lines up with every other cast.
	- _Shadow Word: Death_ does bonus damage. Send it. Super great during the execute phase.
- _Comet Storm_ - chain of swirlies. Run around. Don't get hit.
	- _Penance_ on the move.
- _Frozen Binds_ - root with a large AoE. Re-roots anyone in the circle when it's dispelled.
	- _Blessing of Freedom_ prevents application entirely and can be up for almost every cast (if cast right as it's targeted).
		- Usually the third or fourth one will go through, depending on reaction speed.
	- Pre-position around the edges so that ranged can be dispelled immediately.
	- Wait for melee to move away.
- _Dark Exile_ - sends a player downstairs to run through a gauntlet. 50s to complete the gauntlet or they die.
	- When the player comes back up, they leave an ice puddle on the ground. Should be moved to corners away from the party.
	- _Rescue_ can stop the exile, but the player will still die after 50s.
	- Ensure everyone is topped for this so they can survive the gauntlet.
