## First Pull
- **Nightfall Ritualist** casts _Tormenting Ray_ - biggest danger
	- First two targets are random, but not-tank.
	- Second set will always be the next two DPS.
	- Third set will be tank and someone from first group.
	- Pre-apply _Protective Light_.
- _Stygian Seed_ instant dispel.
## Second Pull - On to Boat
- Another **Nightfall Ritualist** - will have no CDs, so send _Bloodlust_.
- **Nightfall Commander** - kick _Abyssal Howl._
	- Applies _Tainted Slash_ - stacking bleed.
## Side Boats
- **Sureki Webmage** - _Bursting Cocoon_, DoT with a pop on the final tick.
	- _Radiance_ for extra _defensive Penance_ bolts, _Smite_ and _Power Word: Shield_ for last tick.
	- Can be immuned with _Divine Shield_, _Anti-magic Shell_, etc.
- **Nightfall Commander** - kick _Abyssal Howl_.
	- Applies _Tainted Slash_ - stacking bleed.
## First Boss: Speaker Shadowcrown
- _Obsidian Beam_ (lines) - tank needs to have a CD up.
	- Send _Pain Suppression_ if the tank is dry.
	- _Rapture_ if desperate.
- Pre-move _Collapsing Night_.
	- Stand with ranged DPS and move as soon as cast starts.
- _Burning Shadows_ dispel quickly and then heal off _Shadow Shroud_ from party.
	- _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_, _Penance_.
	- Can be poorly timed during _Darkness Comes_.
- _Darkness Comes_ is a long cast that doesn't have to be left until the cast completes.
	- Can't send _Atonement_ healing, boss is immune to damage (not just reduced).
## Cathedral Pull (front door)
- **Nightfall Shadowwalker** - _Umbral Rush_ always targets first aggro target. Let it be the tank.
- **Nightfall Darkcaster** - kick _Umbral Barrier_.
- **Manifested Shadow** - channels _Dark Floes_, a heavy pulsing AoE after approximately one _Mindbender_.
	- Send heavy healing when it goes out, _Barrier_, _Fade_, _Protective Light_.
## Miniboss: Ixkreten the Unbreakable (Cathedral/Slam)
- _Terrifying Slam_ - heavy tankbuster/AoE fear that may require externals.
- _Abyssal Blast_ - heavy DoT that is good _Mindbender_ timer.
	- Can LoS in doorway/corner of doorway/corner of hallway depending on route.
- Try not to send _Mindbender_ late if heading to **Ascendant Viscoxria** next.
## Miniboss: Deathscreamer Ikentak (Inn/Orb)
- Dangerous overlap between _Dark Orb_ pop and _Abyssal Blast_ DoT.
	- Need _Fade_, _Protective Light_ and _Power Word: Shield_ if _Abyssal Blast_ is on during _Dark Orb_ pop.
- _Abyssal Blast_ - heavy DoT that is good _Mindbender_ timer.
	- Can LoS _Abyssal Blast_ on corner of building to push cast towards someone with defensives.
	- Send _defensive Penance_ and layer _Rapture_.
- Try not to send _Mindbender_ late if heading to **Ascendant Viscoxria** next.
## Miniboss: Ascendant Viscoxria (House/Scream)
- Land on roof if early.
- Opens with _Shadowy Decay_ - pulsing AoE.
	- _Mindbender_ as early as possible so that you can farm it back for each cycle (~24s)
	- Hold _Mind Blast_ for each one 
	- Send _Barrier_ if between _Mindbender_/_Mind Blast_ combos.
- _Abyssal Blast_ - heavy DoT.
	- Can LoS in the doorway of the house or the corner.
## Second Boss: Anub'ikkaj
- Open with _Mind Blast_ as it'll be back with _Power Infusion_.
- _Dark Orb_ 
	- Pre-_Atonement_ as _Dark Orb_ is heading out for _Lenience_ DR and shielding
	- Use regular healing to top off after _Dark Orb_ if naked _Atonement_ won't be enough - not sending heavy _Atonement_ healing for these.
	- 4th _Dark Orb_ overlaps with 3rd _Shadowy Decay_:
		- _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Desperate Prayer_, _Barrier_/_Zephyr_/_AMZ_/etc., double-_Radiance_.
- _Shadowy Decay_ - pulsing AoE that does more damage per tick.
	- ~3-4s before the cast, send _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, then spam _Smite_.
	- ~0.5s before cast finishes, double-_Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand_, _Smite_, _Shadow Word: Death_
		- If done correctly, _Entropic Rift_ will close as the damage ends.
		- Will have double-_Radiance_ for every other _Shadowy Decay_ if you don't send any for _Dark Orbs_.
	- Larger breathing room after third _Shadowy Decay_ (overlap with 4th _Dark Orb_) to stabilize party.
- _Animate Shadows_ - summons adds. Bait into melee range then move back out for _Terrifying Slam_.
- _Terrifying Slam_ - heavy tankbuster/AoE fear that may require externals.
## Nightfall Architect (last trash)
- _Tormenting Eruption_ works the same way as _Tormenting Ray_ but scarier.
	- May need to send externals here depending on timing of **Anub'ikkaj** death.
	- Send _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_ just before cast starts.
## Third Boss: Rasha'nan
### First Phase
- _Rolling Acid_ - targeted damage.
	- _Power Word: Shield_ target.
	- May want external if they're out of defensives.
- _Erosive Spray_ - heavy AoE damage and lingering DoT.
	- _Mindbender_ ~5-7s before cast then _Smite_ while waiting.
	- _Mind Blast_ as cast starts.
	- Double-_Radiance_ for every second cast.
	- Try to send two _Dark Reprimands_ into _Entropic Rift_ - can be tight depending on how early _Mindbender_ and the first _Dark Reprimand_ goes out.
- Can't really help with bombs as Disc.
### Second Phase
- _Mindbender_ on pull for damage, will have it farmed back in time.
- _Rolling Acid_
- _Spinneret's Strands_ - targeted AoE web with pop once web is snapped (_Spinneret's Websnap_)
	- Only targets DPS players.
	- _Protective Light_ as this goes out.
	- _Flash Heal_ to top so that we can keep a double-_Radiance_ for _Erosive Spray_.
	- May need to pre-external if they can't get out of the _Sticky Webs_ quickly.
	- _Leap of Faith_ can help prevent the _Sticky Web_ damage, but pops the _Websnap_ immediately.
- _Erosive Spray_
