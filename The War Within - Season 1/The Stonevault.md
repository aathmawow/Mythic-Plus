## First Pull
- _Bloodlust_ and all cooldowns!
- Sometimes just the hallway, sometimes to one of the extra _Earth Infused Golem_ packs in boss room.
- **Earth Infused Golem** - _Ground Pound_ 30yd AoE.
	- Stand at range and send _Radiance_ off the tank to cover melee DPS to avoid all damage to self.
- **Ghastly Voidsoul** - kick _Howling Fear_
- **Cursedheart Invader**:
	- _Arcing Void_ - chain lightning effect that does high damage on a 6yd jump. Hurts if casts go off in heavy melee group.
	- _Void Infection_ - heavy DoT damage. Shadow damage, which gets extra DR from _Embrace the Shadows_ (heals 100% of the 3% damage it absorbs) when on you.
		- Curse cleansers are your buddies.
- **Repurposed Loaderbot** - _Pulverizing Pounce_ - dodge it.
	- Playing at distance for the _Ground Pound_ damage - don't get locked out of range by running backwards, try to sidestep or run forward.
## First Boss: E.D.N.A.
- _Mindbender_ on pull, will be farmed back in time for _Earth Shatter_.
- Easiest _Volatile Spike_ order for Disc: 1, 1, 4
	- Pop one spike with _Refracting Beam_, twicej, pop 4 spikes with _Earth Shatter_.
- _Refracting Beam_:
	- _Radiance_, _Smite_, _Penance_
- _Earth Shatterer_:
	- Starts with _Refracting Beam_ that needs to be healed through:
		- Pre-_Atonement_, _Mindbender_ after second hit, _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand_, _Smite_ and _Shadow Word: Death_ through spike explosion.
		- Pre-_Atonement_ with _Rapture_ (if it's up), _Smiting_ between casts for _Darkness from Light_ (4pc)
	- _Halo_ is actually alright here, but doesn't feel good later.
- _Seismic Smash_ - tankbuster that applies magic DoT (_Seismic Reverberation_).
	- Dispel applies _Stone Shield_, 50% DR for 6s.
	- Dispel before or during subsequent _Seismic Smash_ casts or when tank calls for dispel.
	- Can squeeze casts in during the cast bar for _Seismic Smash_, which helps with overlap on _Earth Shatterer_ and _Refracting Beam_
- Try not to send _Mindbender_ as boss is dying, want it for the next pull.
## Boss Room Trash
- May pull both trash packs after boss.
- **Void Bound Despoiler** - _Void Outburst_ heavy pulsing AoE damage over 6 seconds. 
	- Want _Mindbender_ for this. If you don't have it, need to call for a party defensive or _Ancestral Guidance_.
- **Aspiring Forgehand** - _Fracturing Blow_  - stacking debuff that increases damage taken. 
	- Hold _Pain Suppression_ for high stacks..
## Skarmorak Hallway
- **Void Bound Howler** - _Piercing Wail_ - AoE damage that increases damage from other _Piercing Wails_ - priority interrupts.
- **Turned Speaker** - _Censoring Gear_ targeted silence. Magic debuff that can be dispelled. Kick whenever possible.
	- Can be LoS'd easily on terrain in the hallway. Try not to get caught in the middle of the junction.
- **Cursedheart Invader**:
	- _Arcing Void_ - chain lightning effect that does high damage on a 6yd jump. Hurts if casts go off in heavy melee group.
	- _Void Infection_ - heavy DoT damage. Shadow damage, which gets extra DR from _Embrace the Shadows_ (heals 100% of the 3% damage it absorbs) when on you.
		- Curse cleansers are your buddies.
- **Void Touched Elemental** - _Crystal Salvo_ dodge swirlies.
- **Void Bound Despoiler** can be deadly, especially if tank double pulls in the boss room.
	- Be prepared with _Barrier_ and _Rapture_ coverage as casts start.
## Second Boss (usually): Skarmorak
- _Crystalline Smash_ - tankbuster that spawns _Crystal Shards_.
	- Used to be able to _Divine Shield_ or _Blessing of Protection_ the hit to prevent shards from spawning. Probably not worth it at higher keys where you need the buffs to keep up with the shield and damage. May not work anymore.
- _Crystal Shard_ - pops for heavy damage on death.
	- Should be popped carefully, but quickly.
	- Any _Crystal Shards_ left alive will buff _Fortified Shell_ immensely.
- _Fortified Shell_ + _Void Discharge_ - Shield with AoE pulses:
	- Always have _Mindbender_ combo.
	- Always have at least two stacks of _Unstable Energy_ (orbs):
		- Claim one or two extra stacks if they're left to rot (careful, though, as it increases damage).
	- _Shadow Word: Death_ does bonus damage to the shield, which means more healing during pulses.
	- Usually have time for a _Mindbender_ between cycles to help with healing shard pops.
## Machinists Hallway
- Probably hardest part of the dungeon.
- **Forgebound Mender** - _Restoring Metals_ heal. Priority kick.
	- _Alloy Bolt_ hurts and should be kicked or stopped where possible.
- **Forge Loader**:
	- _Lava Cannon_ - dodge the orb dummy.
	- _Molten Mortar_ - heavy DoT that needs big defensives.
		- _Rapture_ with _Smite_ and/or _Penance_ between to cover damage.
- Can skip corner pack of **Aspiring Forgehands** with _Mind Soothe_ and another CC.
- **Repurposed Loaderbot** - _Pulverizing Pounce_ - dodge the swirly. Duh.
## Forge Room
- May pull a lot of trash to **Imbued Iron Bar** if you have a Warrior, Dwarf, or Blacksmith - 10% Versatility is pretty critical for covering the boss damage.
- May go opposite direction if you can't get buff - nothing special.
- Can _Mind Soothe_ mobs near the cart for return trip.
## Third Boss (usually): Master Machinists
- Second _Bloodlust_.
- Remaining boss casts _Silenced Speaker_ if one boss dies before the other.
	- Nearly guaranteed wipe if the second boss doesn't die quickly. Watch enemy health bars and be prepared for heavy damage.
### Speaker Brokk (Earthen)
- _Exhaust Vents_ - 10 second DoT and activates vents. Look at flames to find safe vent, don't stand in red vent.
	- MUST have _Mindbender_ and _Mind Blast_.
	- Casted spell, not an immediate damage. DoTs don't start until cast completes.
	- _Mindbender_ ~3-5s ahead of cast start so there's time to farm for next event.
		- Need extra time to farm back for the next _Exhaust Vents_.
	- _Mind Blast_ as cast completes so _Entropic Rift_ is exploding as DoTs fall off.
	- Use _Dark Reprimand_ while moving.
		- Maybe ask for _Spatial Paradox_.
	- End coincides with _Blazing Crescendo_.
- _Scrap Song_ - don't stand in the middle idiot.
	- Ranged kick or send someone to kick _Molten Metal_ after cube finishes moving.
### Speaker Dorlita (mech)
- _Igneous Hammer_ - tankbuster. May need _Pain Suppression_ if tank runs dry.
- _Blazing Crescendo_ - heavy party AoE. Move to safe vent and pop defensives.
	- Overlaps with end of _Exhaust Vents_.
- _Lava Cannon_ - don't get hit by the orb or git gud.
## Final Hallway
- Two **Cursedforge Honor Guard** at entrance can be skipped with a Night Elf.
	- Aggro them, run them in a circle, let them charge away, run back to hallway then _Shadowmeld_ to reset.
- **Rock Smasher** - _Smash Rock_ does heavy AoE damage to all players and leaves debuff that increases damage from next cast.
	- Needs a defensive CD every time - _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Rapture_, etc.
		- After +16s, needs party DRs like _Zephyr_, _Barrier_, etc.
- **Cursedforge Honor Guard**:
	- _Shield Stampede_ - dodge dummy. Bait into walls so melee DPS can maintain uptime.
	- _Stonebreaker Strike_ - heavy tank buster. May need to send _Pain Suppression_.
- **Cursedforge Stoneshaper**:
	- _Earth Burst Totem_ - summons a totem that will kill everyone if its cast goes off. Priority target.
	- _Stone Bolt_ - targeted cast into tank. Will destroy them. Kick and stop as many as possible.
	- Can be stunned to delay totems if needed.
- **Cursedforge Mender** - _Restoring Metals_ heals. Priority kick.
- Sometimes double-pull **Rock Smashers** in final room.
	- Third _Bloodlust_, potions, etc. and burn as fast as possible before debuff stacks up.
	- _Smash Rock_ can get sync'd up and will require party defensives.
	- If pulled separately, reset debuff stacks before pulling the second set.
## Fourth Boss: Void Speaker Eirich
- No real healing check if the party is decent. 
	- MAX DPS.
	- Just top people after _Entropic Reckoning_ and watch for high _Void Corruption_ stacks.
- _Void Corruption_ - stacking DoT that needs to be dropped into portals.
	- Pre-position for portals.
	- _Rescue_ can clear two debuffs with one portal.
	- Dangerous overlap with _Entropic Reckoning_ if people don't cleanse early.
	- Send _Pain Suppression_ or big _Rapture_ if someone doesn't cleanse.
- _Entropic Reckoning_ - drops puddles and damages around target.
	- Try to drop around outside away from active portals.
- _Unbridled Void_ - conal that follows _Entropic Reckoning_. Dodge.
	- May need to stack _Feather_ and _defensive Penance_ for move speed buff if tank drops puddles on the opposite side from you.
		- May need to use _Leap of Faith_ on some poor sucker for the same reason.
