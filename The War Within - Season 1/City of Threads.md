```
- _Phantasm_ - dispel snare DoT on second boss.
- _Mass DIspel_ - dispel snare DoT on second boss.
## Umbral Bazaar
- Get buff: Priest, Rogue, Engineering
- **Royal Swarmguard** - _Ravenous Swarm_, AoE DoT
	- Send _Mindbender_ early to reset for second one.
	- Can be really dangerous if it's applied right before it dies, leaving you nothing to _Atonement_ off of.
- **Herald of Ansurek** - _Shadows of Doubt_, magic debuff that needs to be dispelled quickly. Shoots orbs when dispelled that stun targets it hits.
	- Pre-position at far to give time for dodges then trust DPS not to be bad.
## First Boss: Orator Krix'vizk
- First _Bloodlust_.
- _Shadows of Doubt_ - applies to two targets.
	- _Mindbender_ timing - dispel one and let the second expire while healing.
	- _Mind Blast_ here - _Entropic Rift_ should stick around to the AoE.
	- Trust DPS that the balls won't be sent through the boss.
- _Subjugate_ - heavy tankbuster. May need to send _Pain Suppression_ or _Barrier_.
- _Vociferous Indoctrination_ - moderate pulsing AoE.
	- If _Mindbender_ was timed well, should have ~4s remaining
	- _Entropic Rift_ should be popping early in it.
	- _Radiance_ into _Dark Reprimand_.
## Hide 'n Seek
- **Xeph'itik** - dodge swirlies.
- **Eye of the Queen** - _Void Rush_, heavy party-wide DoT.
	- _Mindbender_ early for DoT to get reset for the second cast.
	- Can't generally get _Mindbender_ up for every cast outside of _Power Infusion_.
	- Send direct healing (_Flash Heal_) to cover during the second cast, don't waste _Mindbender_ by sending it late.
- **Agile Pursuer** (2-4th pack)  - _Knife Throw_, random target damage. 
	- Hurts a surprising amount and may require some extra pump when lined up with _Void Rush_.
	- Ideally send stops while _Void Rush_ damage is out to offset the damage.
- **Web Marauder** (2-4th pack) - _Rigorous Jab_, stacking tank damage.
- **Covert Webmancer** (4th pack) - _Mending Web_, heal. Priority kick.
## Second Boss: Fangs of the Queen
- Second _Bloodlust_.
-  Don't open with _Mindbender_ - send _Rapture_ shield for _Knife Throw_ damage.
### Phase One (Ice Sickles)
- _Ice Sickles_ + _Duskbringer_ - AoE plus targeted AoE w/snaring DoT.
	- Send _Mindbender_ ~5s before combo to heal the AoE damage.
	- Can double-_Radiance_.
	- _Fade_ with _Phantasm_ will remove snare-DoT.
	- _Mass Dispel_ or _Jet Stream_ can remove entire set of DoTs for the party.
	- Dodge _Duskbringer_ zones.
- _Synergic Step_ - Dash attack. Dodge lines.
	- Bait into walls and the dash won't move them, letting melee maintain uptime.
	- _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_, _Penance_ on the move.
### Phase Two (Rime Dagger)
- Bosses run towards center of room.
- _Rime Dagger_ - AoE damage that is removed by stacking on the tank.
	- Single _Rime Dagger_ followed ~5s later by a second cast that overlaps with _Duskbringer_.
	- Pre-_Atonement_ for first cast.
	- Send _Mindbender_ as the first _Rime Dagger_ goes out.
	- _Mind Blast_, _Radiance_.
	- _Dark Reprimand_ as second _Rime Dagger_ goes out so you can move out of _Duskbringer_.
## Bridge-to-Venomshell
- Hold _Power Infusion_ for the **Royal Venomshell**.
- **Sureki Conscript** - _Brutal Jab_, stacking debuff that increases physical damage taken. May require _Pain Suppression_ at high stacks.
- **Web Marauder** - _Rigorous Jab_, stacking tank damage.
- **Agile Pursuer** - _Knife Throw_, random target damage. Priority stop.
## Miniboss: Royal Venomshell
- _Poison Cleansing Totem_ is your best friend.
	- Otherwise poison cleanses are second best friend.
- _Venomous Spray_ - heavy AoE poison DoT with swirlies.
	- _Mindbender_ for each. _Power Infusion_ should make it easy.
	- Hold _Penance_ for movement even if it means not getting a second one into _Entropic Rift_.
	- If stranded between _Mindbender_, hold for the next cast and send something else like _Barrier_ or _Rapture_.
## Hallways
- **Sureki Unnaturaler** - _Void Wave_, knockback with stacking DoT. Priority kicks.
	- Position so that knockback won't send you into webs.
- **Unstable Test Subject**
	- _Fierce Stomping_, pulsing AoE damage.
		- Possible to outrange? 20yds according to tooltip.
		- _Mindbender_ for this damage window.
	- _Dark Barrage_, swirlies, don't get hit.
## Third Boss: The Coaglamation
- Third _Bloodlust_.
- _Viscous Darkness_ - knockback that summons orbs.
	- Pre-_Atonement_ with regular casts, not _Radiance_.
	- _Corrupted Coating_ - from absorbing orbs. Stacking heal absorb. Try to take evenly so that personal healing can help.
	- Orbs immediately drop _Black Blood_ puddles when they're absorbed, so move through orbs rather than letting them hit you.
	- Ideally tank is not absorbing many, because of the heal reduction from _Oozing Smash_.
- _Oozing Smash_ - tankbuster with a 30% heal reduction.
	- May need to send _Pain Suppression_ if the tank is dry. Hard to heal back up from so needs to be mitigated.
- _Blood Surge_ - PBAoE that drops a _Black Blood_ pool. Tank should be moving around to keep people out of it. Don't get caught in the AoE.
- _Dark Pulse_ - heavy pulsing AoE damage. Biggest healing event.
	- _Barrier_ and self-_Pain Suppression_ can be important - _Fade_ and _Protective Light_ every time.
	- _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, double-_Radiance_, _Dark Reprimand_, _Void Blast_, _Shadow Word: Death_ - every time.
	- Overlaps with _Viscous Darkness_ on
	- Have time for a second _Mindbender_ between casts.
## Minibosses: Hulking Warshell & Elder Shadeweaver
### Elder Shadeweaver
- _Umbral Weave_ - heavy AoE damage and web root that needs to be broken.
	- Stack for damage so the webs can be cleaved down.
	- _Blessing of Freedom_ is your buddy.
	- _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Shield_ every time.
- _Web Bolt_ - targeted spell. Hurts. Kick it.
- Don't send _Mindbender_ late on the fight, it's needed at the start of the **Hulking Warshell**.
### Hulking Warshell
- Good place for _Power Infusion_ so we can get _Mindbender_ resets.
- _Ravenous Swarm_ - heavy AoE DoT.
	- First spell he casts on pull - full healing.
	- _Mindbender_, _Mind Blast_, _Dark Reprimand_, _Smite_, etc.
- _Tremor Slam_ - heavy AoE burst damage.
	- Top off party between each one as best as possible.
	- _Fade_ and _Protective Light_.
	- Overlaps with _Ravenous Swarm_ on second and third cast.
		- Send party defensives here.
- Try to hold _Mindbender_ late into fight. Bridge with _Rapture_. Want _Mindbender_ for **Izo, the Grand Splicer**.
## Fourth Boss: Izo, the Grand Splicer
- _Splice_ - heavy AoE DoT.
	- Send _Mindbender_ ~5s before _Splice_.
- _Tremor Slam_ - heavy AoE burst damage.
	- _Fade_, _Protective Light_, _Power Word: Shield_ on 2 for every cast
