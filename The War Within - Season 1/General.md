## Discipline Priest
- _Mindbender_ should be up for ~17 seconds with the extensions from _Smite_, _Penance_, _Mind Blast_, etc.
- _Atonement_ is a 3% damage reduction (through talent _Lenience_) and it triggers mastery for bonus healing.
- If using _defensive Penance_, ensure that target has _Atonement_ applied.
- When using _Rapture_ if stringing the shields out (rather than blanketing), send a _Penance_ before each one to stack up _Weal and Woe_.
	- Otherwise try to _Smite_ between each one for _Darkness from Light_ (4pc) buff.
- _Atonement_ healing isn't downscaled by damage reduction but won't trigger on mobs that are immune.
- Fish for mobs <20% to get extra casts of _Shadow Word: Death_, extending _Mindbender_ window with _Inescapable Torment_.
- _Penance_ will continue casting even if you lose LoS. Use this when lining spell casts.
